## Overview

This README provides instructions for setting up and integrating a UI for your candy machine, which utilizes an SPL token created in a previous step. Follow the steps below to complete the setup and ensure seamless minting of the SPL token through the UI.

### 1. Create an SPL Token

Ensure you have already created an SPL token, either following the instructions from a previous lesson or using your own implementation. Note down the SPL token address as it will be required for configuring the candy machine UI.

### 2. Update `config.json`

Modify the `config.json` file to use the `splTokenAddress` of the token created in Step 1. This ensures that the candy machine UI interacts with the correct SPL token.

### 3. Set Up UI for Candy Machine

Follow the steps outlined in the tutorial "Quick Node: Set Up a Minting Site" to create a user interface for your candy machine. Ensure you make the necessary adjustments mentioned in the tutorial, such as updating the start script in `package.json` to prevent the `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` error.

### 4. Integration with SPL Token

Ensure that the candy machine UI is configured to accept payment in the SPL token created in Step 1. Modify the minting function in your SPL project to mint to your Phantom address instead of the `fromWallet`, or adjust the transfer function to transfer to your Phantom wallet instead of the `toWallet`.

### 5. Testing

Test the integration by transferring or minting the SPL token to any of your Phantom accounts and attempting to mint on your website. Verify that users can successfully mint candies using the SPL token as payment.

## Additional Considerations

- **User Experience**: Ensure the UI provides clear instructions and feedback to users during the minting process.
- **Security**: Implement secure practices for handling transactions and user data to prevent unauthorized access or exploits.
- **Error Handling**: Handle potential errors gracefully to provide a smooth user experience.
- **Documentation**: Document any modifications made to the codebase for future reference and collaboration.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions during the setup or integration process, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance.

Happy minting!
